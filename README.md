Hi, I’m Enger 👋 — a Software Engineer passionate about clean code, scalable systems, and creative tech projects. I work across web development and backend services with tools like Go, TypeScript, Node.js, and AWS, while also exploring graphics programming and game development with Godot.

Some of my featured projects include **Red Baron**, a retro-inspired aerial combat game in progress, and a **Godot RPG demo**, showcasing action mechanics and indie visuals. Beyond games, I’ve built e-commerce platforms, ERP systems, and cloud-based solutions that improve data accessibility and performance.

I enjoy contributing to open source, mentoring other developers, and experimenting with new technologies. If you’d like to collaborate or just chat about tech, check out my projects or connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/sir-geronimo), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enger-jimenez), or [Instagram](https://instagram.com/sir.geronimo).
